## Description
 Build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so you’ll also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.
 ## Usage
 - GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
- WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
- THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
- WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
- THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
- WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
- WHEN I start the application
- THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
